# Anytype MCP Server

The Anytype MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation, enabling AI assistants to seamlessly interact with Anytype's API through natural language.

## Overview

This project implements an MCP server that acts as a bridge between AI assistants and the Anytype API. It converts Anytype's OpenAPI specification into MCP tools that AI assistants can understand and use.

## Features

- OpenAPI v3.1 specification support
- Automatic conversion of API endpoints to MCP tools
- Secure authentication handling
- CLI tool for testing and development

## Quick Start

1. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Link the package globally (optional):

```bash
npm link
```

3. Get your Anytype API key:

```bash
anytype-mcp get-key
```

4. Add the config to your MCP client settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anytype": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "anytype-mcp",
        "run",
      ],
      "env": {
        "OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS": "{\"Authorization\":\"Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>\", \"Anytype-Version\":\"2025-05-20\"}"
